 * The GraphFrame represents the non-relational result of a query in the labeled property graph model.
 * If the query returns a relational result, such as when aggregations are used or specific properties are returned,
 * a relational frame is used. The GraphFrame is used for results where a set of nodes, edges, or paths is returned.
 * This selection is exclusive, meaning only one of the lists can be populated at a time. If a result produces multiple
 * frames (used to transmit large results), all results will be of the same type (relational vs. graph) and contain the
 * same element type (nodes, edges or paths).
