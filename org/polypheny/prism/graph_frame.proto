 * The GraphFrame represents the non-relational result of a query in the labeled property graph model.
 * If the query returns a relational result, such as when aggregations are used or specific properties are returned,
 * a relational frame is used. The GraphFrame is used for results where a set of nodes and/or edges is returned.
 * The nodes or edges are wrapped in graph elements to allow them to be mixed as paths are returned as a mixed collection of both.
 * If a result produces multiple frames (used to transmit large results), all results will be of the same type (relational vs. graph).
