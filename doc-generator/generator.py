The _Prism Interface_ is a query interface designed specifically for interaction with Polypheny instances. Unlike traditional HTTP-based methods, this state-of-the-art communication channel employs a binary protocol based on Google Protocol Buffers, providing a versatile and efficient method for data exchange.

To interact and use this interface, we provide drivers and connectors for various query languages and technologies:

- [JDBC](/drivers/jdbc/overview)
- Python
- Go


## Features

The "Prism" protocol, integral to Polypheny's query interface, is aptly named to reflect its capability to seamlessly process a diverse array of query languages and data models. Much like a prism dispersing light into a vibrant spectrum, the Prism protocol intricately supports complex queries, delegating them adeptly across various data paradigms. This analogy underscores Prism's role in illuminating the multifaceted nature of data, enabling a harmonious interplay between different data types, akin to the mesmerizing display of colors revealed through a prism.

### Multi-Language Statement

One of the standout features of Prism Interface is its support for multi-language queries. You're not restricted to one query language; the Prism Interface can handle all query languages supported by Polypheny, allowing for greater flexibility in your data operations.

### Results in Different Data Models

Another powerful feature is the ability to retrieve query results in multiple data models. Whether you're dealing with relational, document-based, or the relational data models, Prism Interface can deliver results in the format most suited for your application's needs.

## Why use the Prism Interface?

- **Efficiency**: The use of a binary protocol minimizes overhead, ensuring faster communication between your application and the Polypheny instance.

- **Semantics-Preserving Interaction**: Prism Interface allows for a semantics-preserving interaction with the database's native types and results, ensuring data integrity and accuracy in your operations.

- **Multi-Platform**: Built upon the robust foundations of Google Protocol Buffers, the Prism protocol and API is designed to be used in various different programming languages.


## Acknowledgments

The initial version of the PrismInterface has been developed by [Tobias Hafner](https://github.com/TobiasHafner){:target="_blank"} as part of his Bachelor's thesis at the University of Basel.
